# 3DES MMIO Driver on HF-RISC + UCX/OS

This project implements a **Triple DES (3DES)** encryption system in a minimal embedded stack, using:

- A **VHDL IP core** for the 3DES algorithm (RTL-level)
- A **Memory-Mapped I/O (MMIO)** interface to connect the crypto block to a custom SoC based on **HF-RISC**
- A **UCX/OS microkernel driver**, running on top of this simulated hardware platform

The work was developed using minimal versions of both [HF-RISC](https://github.com/sjohann81/hf-risc) and [UCX/OS](https://github.com/bbzaffari/ucx-os-minimo), provided by the course instructor, Prof. SÃ©rgio Johann.

The driver enables encryption and decryption of arbitrary-length messages via system calls (`write()`, `read()`) and supports the following block cipher modes:

- **ECB (Electronic Codebook)**
- **CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)**
- **CTR (Counter Mode)**

The system includes padding (PKCS#7), task ID management, and validation using real text data, ensuring correct operation across the full encryption pipeline.

## Objective overview of this work

The objective of this work was to implement and validate a device driver for encryption based on the Triple DES (3DES) algorithm on the UCX/OS operating system, running on the HF-RISC-E processor. For this purpose, a 3DES cryptographic core described in hardware (VHDL) and mapped via MMIO on the SoC bus was used.

The application communicates with the driver through the standard calls write() (to encrypt or decrypt data) and read() (to retrieve the result). The driver implements task control, access permission verification by Task ID, and supports the ECB (Electronic Code Book) mode. Tests were conducted with real messages and padding management following the PKCS#7 standard.

Additionally, optimizations were made in the communication with the cryptographic IP, including checking the READY signal before reading the output, thus avoiding race conditions. The driver's structure allows modularity for future modes (CBC, CTR) and ensures data integrity in the encrypted input/output process. The main application was used to test the complete encryption and decryption pipeline, validating the correctness of the implemented algorithm.

## Validation:
The validation process was carried out using the hexdump function, which displays the binary content of a file in hexadecimal and ASCII format for low-level inspection.
The output (stdout) is saved in the [`debug.txt`](https://github.com/bbzaffari/minimal-HF-RISC-V/blob/6a5041a4e47189d85cda550ba80e718dcd1fe7e8/sim/rv32e_basic/debug.txt) file, accessible from this location.

# How to Set Up the Environment
**In three steps:** ***`Clone -> Docker Setup-> Starting the container`***


## 1st Clone 

```bash
git clone --recurse https://github.com/bbzaffari/MMIO-tripleDes-VHDL-core
````

---

## 2nd Docker Setup

For the purposes of this class, the professor provided a pre-configured Docker environment that includes all the necessary dependencies for the system to run properly.
You can download and set it up using the following command:

### 1. Docker pull the pre-built image
```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/sjohann81/linux-es

````

###  2. Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -it --name SE -v "$PWD":/home ghcr.io/sjohann81/linux-es
```

* ***docker run*** **is more than just "starting a container." Itâ€™s a compound command** that:
   - 1. Creates a new container from the specified image (ghcr.io/sjohann81/linux-es) â€” this is like taking a blueprint (image) and building a working instance (container).
   - 2. Allocates resources like filesystem layers, network, and isolated namespaces.
   - 3. Configures the container with options like terminal interaction (-it), naming (--name), volume mounting (-v), and more.
   * 4. Runs the container by executing its default entrypoint (in this case, a shell environment).
   
* **`-it`**: Allocates an interactive terminal so you can use the command line inside the container.
* **`--name SE***`**: Names the container `SE`, which helps you reference it easily later.
* **`-v "$PWD":/home`**: Mounts your current working directory (from your host machine) into the container at the path `/home`.

> **Notes**:
> - ***1. After the first run, do not repeat the docker run command, or you'll create duplicate containers.***
>    * 1. This can lead to:
>    * 2. Confusion (multiple containers with similar configurations)
>    * 3. Conflicts over mounted volumes
>    * 4. Wasted disk space and dangling containers
> 
> * ***2. `$PWD` is an environment variable that returns your current working directory.***
>    * That directory **must contain the files you previously cloned** from the project repository.
>    * Inside the container, those files will be accessible at `/home`.

---
## 3rd â€” Starting/accessing the container 

Once you've created the container using `docker run`, ***you don't need to recreate it again.***
Instead, follow these two simple commands to ***reuse*** the container:

#### 1. `docker start SE`
```bash
docker start SE
````
This command **starts an existing container** that has already been created earlier using `docker run`.

* `SE` is the name you assigned to the container when you first ran it.
* This command starts the container **in the background** â€” it doesnâ€™t attach to its terminal.

#### 2. `docker exec -it SE bash`
```bash
docker exec -it SE bash
```
This command **attaches a terminal to the running container**, allowing you to interact with it just like you would with a regular Linux shell.

* `-it`: Opens an interactive terminal session.
* `SE`: Refers to the container you started.
* `bash`: Launches the Bash shell inside the container.

> - Use `start + exec` every time you want to return to the container after rebooting or closing Docker â€” **never `docker run` again** for this purpose.
> - Together, these two commands will bring you **back into your development environment** inside the container â€” ready to compile, run, and edit your project files that were mounted in `/home`.

# How to run:

1. It is assumed that the files are located in the `/home` directory.
2. Sometimes `debug.txt` is automatically deleted, but simply running the command again resolves it.
3. Validation was performed using `debug.txt`, with output inspected via `hexdump`.
